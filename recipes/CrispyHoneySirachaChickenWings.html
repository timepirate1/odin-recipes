    <p>
        Crispy Honey Sriracha Chicken Wings are a delicious and simple recipe that uses a unique baking powder-laced spice rub to achieve a crispy texture similar to fried wings. The wings are baked, turned twice, and glazed with a mix of honey, sriracha, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. A sprinkle of sesame seeds adds a nice finishing touch. This method creates a flavorful and crispy dish that's perfect for any occasion.
